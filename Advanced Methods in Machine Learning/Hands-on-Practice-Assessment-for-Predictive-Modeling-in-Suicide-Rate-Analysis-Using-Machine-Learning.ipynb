    "### Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practice assignment, you will use a compiled dataset from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016, to predict suicide rates using both one-hot encoded and numerical features. You will build a Multiple Linear Regression model aimed at predicting the increasing suicide rates. The objective of this assignment is to apply various feature engineering techniques and assess the model's performance with each approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through the assignment, you may encounter questions or challenges requiring additional clarification. In such cases, you can access hidden solutions by clicking the \"Click Here\" option. This feature is designed to guide you and help deepen your understanding of the material, ensuring you complete the assignment effectively.\n",

    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Develop multiple linear regression models using one-hot encoding and original numerical features.\n",
    "* Evaluate model performance and understand metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n",

    "#### Advantage of Using Regression with nominal features\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem the target variable `suicides/100k pop` used to predict suicide rates is a continous variable. Whenever we are having the outcome variable to be a continous variable, we need to apply regression techniques rather than classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is generally used when the target variable is a categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our present problem we encounter several nominal or categorical features such as `age`,`sex`,`generation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can still build the regression model here as we use suitable feature engineering techniques such as `One-hot encoding` which will  transform these features to a form suitable for regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we are preserving the relationship between the categories and the continuous outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantage of Using Regular Numerical values rather than one-hot encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use one-hot encoding, the dimensionality increases because each categorical feature is converted into multiple binary columns, potentially resulting in a significant number of additional columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this issue does not arise with regular numerical values, thus reducing the dimensionality.\n",
